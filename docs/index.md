#  Magento 2 integration

This Magneto 2 Integration features an SDK and middleware which is framework-agnostic. Popular choices for frameworks include [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
These are great frameworks, but it's up to you which framework you use, or if you use a framework at all. The SDK is built using TypeScript and can be installed in any JavaScript or TypeScript application.

If you'd like a ready-to-go UI solution for eCommerce, consider using [Storefront UI](https://docs.storefrontui.io/v2/)

:::tip
You will need a Magento 2 project as a backend. If you don't already have one, you can run `npx @vue-storefront/cli m2-only` to quickly set up a local instance.
For a more detailed guide to using the CLI to create a local Magento 2 instance see: [Magento Installation](./getting-started/magento.md)

This SDK is developed and maintained by the Vue Storefront team.
