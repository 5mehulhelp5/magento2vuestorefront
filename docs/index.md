# Magento 2 SDK

This Magneto 2 SDK is framework-agnostic. If you'd like a ready to go UI Solution for eCommerce checkout [Storefront UI](https://docs.storefrontui.io/v2/)

You will need a Magento 2 project as a backend. If you don't already have one, you can run `npx @vue-storefront/cli m2-only` to quickly set up a local instance.

This SDK is developed and maintained by the Vue Storefront team.
